	- Make it so the starting run() method of the letter counter simply needs to invoke a static method,
	  e.g., "count" to start the letter counting of an array of strings.
	- Method count should check if the array is bigger than SLICE_SIZE (defined as a static constant);
	  if so, it should split the array in two and invoke count on these
	  two slices in parallel (using an executor).
	- When the two sub-computations are done, collect the results.
	- At the end, output the total count of words.
